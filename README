ABSTRACT
Structured light scanning software for use in detecting the 3D position of projector pixels when scattered by a non-planar object. This project was originally developed for Kimchi and Chips' Lit Tree (http://www.kimchiandchips.com/littree.php), and will be evolved into a more general purpose tool as part of the MapTools initiative for open source projection mapping tools.
